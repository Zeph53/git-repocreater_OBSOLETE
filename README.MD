# GIT-REPOCREATER  

This is a little Bash script to basically instantly upload stuff to GitHub.  
Just add an argument to the command used to run the script.  
Then it should create the repository directly on GitHub.  

## Installation  
#### Just download the ZIP and extract it somewhere, or clone the repository:
    sudo git clone https://github.com/Zeph53/git-repocreater/
    sudo cd git-repocreater/
#### If you really wanted to, it can be added to "/usr/bin". Which makes it globally executable within Bash. 
    sudo git clone https://github.com/Zeph53/git-repocreater/
    sudo cp -r git-repocreater/git-repocreater.bash /usr/bin/
    sudo gio trash --force git-repocreater/
## Uninstallation  
#### Remove the script from your system:
    sudo gio trash --force ~/git-repocreater/
#### Or, if you installed it to "/usr/bin", remove the script from the binaries directory:
    sudo gio trash --force /usr/bin/git-repocreater.bash
## Usage  
#### Simply execute the script with the file or folder that you would like to create a repository of as an argument, for example:
    sudo git-repocreater.bash "~/git-repocreater/git-repocreater.bash"
#### And then follow the directions presented by the terminal.
